# Puissance4_py
It's a simple "Connect 4", in python

But I implemented some special capacities, such as "Inverting the token of a line or a column".
There is a mini-game when there is a draw between the players (you have a ship that can fire bullet, and you must kill the other)

Maybe I play with connexion, via internet one day ?

Assets are not mine, so I didn't upload them
